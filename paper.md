# Summary

<!--
List all authors and affiliations.
Describe the submission, and explain its eligibility for JOSE.
Include a _Statement of Need_, explaining how the submitted artifacts contribute to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be adopted by others.
For learning modules, describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in teaching and learning situations.
Tell us the "story" of the project: how did it come to be?
List key references including a link to the open archive of the sofware or the learning module. -->

This is to be a collaboration among scientific computing researchers and educators to develop accessible tutorial materials and minimal templates that empower researchers developing new analysis techniques to release them in formats that encourage community adoption. We're working open to model the practices that the lesson teaches. By working open, we hope to increase the impact of the templates and tutorials by encouraging learners to contribute back.


FIXME is an open curriculum to teach researchers to release their python code in ways that better support repeatability and collaboration. The lesson design follows the Carpentries style: learner centric, accessible and delivered with participatory live coding.  The lesson will teach concepts of project organization, packaging, environments, documentation, and publishing.  These are topics that many researchers won't know: whether self-taught or focused on theory, these very practical aspects are not learned.

I hope my curriculum can move us from a state where a lot of research code is not released, and what much of is released is a set script that makes it easy to reproduce a paper's result, but make it hard to compare a new technique or apply a method to a new dataset.
To get there, I aim to fill a gap in training researchers with minimal practices they can adopt without requiring learning  too many specialized tools. I found that a lot of documentation and tools for these concepts focus on bigger  software projects and I think data analysis projects have slightly different nature and deserve their own support in the form of tutorials and conventions.
